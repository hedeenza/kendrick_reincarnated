Examination of the theory that the lyrics from Kendrick Lamar's 2024 "Reincarnated" snippet found at the beginning of the music video for "Not Like Us" released on 2024 July 4 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H58vbez_m4E&pp=ygUabm90IGxpa2UgdXMga2VuZHJpY2sgbGFtYXI%3D) actually reference to songs that Drake stole lyrics from. I learned about the theory from a stiched video (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TcoOuVaJ660) from @AndyLDooley, originally posted 2024 July 22. I don't know who the original video was made by.
